# ðŸŽ­ MoodMatch: Emotion-Based Netflix Recommender System

MoodMatch is a smart Netflix show recommender system that detects user mood from movie descriptions and recommends content accordingly. This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline using **Pandas**, **TextBlob**, and **Scikit-learn**, with real-world Netflix data.

ðŸ“–*Project Description*
Have you ever opened Netflix and spent more time scrolling than actually watching something? Youâ€™re not alone â€” with so many shows available, itâ€™s easy to get overwhelmed. Plus, our mood plays a big role in what we feel like watching. When weâ€™re happy, we might want a light-hearted comedy, but on tougher days, we might prefer something more emotional or intense.

Thatâ€™s exactly why we created MoodMatch â€” a smart Netflix recommender system that suggests shows based on how you feel. Instead of searching endlessly, you just tell MoodMatch your mood, and it recommends a list of shows that match that emotional vibe.

But this isnâ€™t just a cool idea â€” itâ€™s also a full data science project. Behind the scenes, we use a real Netflix dataset and build a complete data pipeline that:

Extracts and cleans the raw data

Uses TextBlob (a natural language processing tool) to analyze the sentiment of each showâ€™s description

Tags each show with a mood like *Happy, Neutral, or Dark*

Trains a machine learning model using *scikit-learn* to improve accuracy

Recommends shows based on the detected mood

Itâ€™s a fun and useful way to apply what weâ€™ve learned in data science â€” from data cleaning and sentiment analysis to machine learning and user interaction.

MoodMatch isnâ€™t just about code. Itâ€™s about making content feel more personal and helping people find something that truly fits their moment. This project could easily grow in the future â€” imagine voice-based mood input, chatbot integration, or even a web app where your face or words decide what you watch next.
